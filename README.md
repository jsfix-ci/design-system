# LiveChat Design System

> **Warning**
> The [develop](https://github.com/livechat/design-system/tree/develop) branch currently represents a stable, but not an actively developed version of `design-system`. Packages [released](https://github.com/livechat/design-system/releases) as stable are in maintenance mode and we address only critical issues. The LiveChat team is currently working on a version that is being built from scratch and can be found under the [v1](https://github.com/livechat/design-system/tree/v1) branch. The progress of the work is available in the [project's roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/livechat/projects/7).

By creating a uniform system, we want to deliver a harmonious experience to our customers.
For someone whoâ€™s already used one of our products, the transition to another one would be smooth and intuitive.
